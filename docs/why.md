# Why

While Bing Image Creator lets you create many images from prompts and these can be access by URL, the history of the web app is limited to a small number of items so you cannot navigate to your old creations unless you know the exact URL. So this means most of your creations could be lost.

If you entered a prompt and got a result, then that page of creations will actually exist in your browser's history (at least until you clear it, so it could be a very long time). This

This project takes advantage of this - it lets you take the AI image URLs from your history, as far back as possible, and then run a Python script to download them all to your machine.

And then you can analyze to see what text works best based on your image results, and then you can go and back even better images.
