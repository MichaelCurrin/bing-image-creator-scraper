# Bing Image Creator Scraper
> Bulk-download your AI images and prompts created with Bing, based on relevant URLs you provide from your browser history

Go through each browser on each computer where you use Bing Image Creator to create images. Put those together as one list of URLs then you scrape with this Python tool to get all the prompts and images downloaded That you should cover everything you ever created (as long as you didn't clear your history).

Note, you are **not** guaranteed to get all images. Whether you use this scraper or navigate directly in the browser, some of the images appear as not available. It seems like Bing removes older creations from its storage.

For info on Bing Image Creator and installation and usage instructions, see the [docs](/docs/).
